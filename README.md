## Application
Goal of this app is to help VHDL designers to quickly adopt modern
verification technologies. Benefits include:

* Coverage Driven Verification
* Structured logging
* Reusable, Layered testbench components
* Separate testcases from testbench etc.

It is developed in Python. Currently it supports the popular OSVVM 
styled testbenches. If you need a variant such as VUnit, UVVM etc. drop
us a note, we will consider depending on customer interests and bandwidth.

## Input YAML specification
We use YAML file to specify the DUT interface. More details can be found at:

[YAML for VHDL Design interface specification](af_yaml_spec.md)

Given a YAML file as input, this app generates necessary files 
to simulate a given DUT. 

## Prerequisites

Python 3.x
Modelsim - 2020.1 or later
OSVVM recent release

## Use Model


To run a simple demo, do the following steps:

1. cd examples
2. cd up_down_counter
3. python3 ../../py_src/af_pyvhg_osvvm.py -y dut_src/af_up_dn_counter.yml

This should create a bunch of TB files and a sim_dir to run simulations. 

For any new design, please create a YAML file as shown in this example:
dut_src/af_up_dn_counter.yml

Once the step-3 above is done, follow the steps shown in README file 
generated by the app. Quick steps:

4. cd sim_dir
5. make mti

## Support
This is an ongoing development project with active features being added. Feel free to open a GitHub issue if you need new features, bug reports etc. Thanks!

## Roadmap

1. Support for generics
2. Functional coverage
3. Other EDA tools support
